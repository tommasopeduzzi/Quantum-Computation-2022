# Noise
There are three main mechanisms that produce noise:
- Measurement by outsiders
- Hamiltionian acting on the qubit in an unknown way (for example magnetic field on spin qubit)
- Hamilition interacting qubit with enviroment

This can be combined into one single object that describes the noise, and such a single solution. But takng into account all of the possible environmelntal factors is infeasable.

We can create the effects of such environments in Kraus operators, which is not unitary.
